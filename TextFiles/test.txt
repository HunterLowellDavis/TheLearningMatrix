Here is your optimized virtual learning environment:
Zoom
If possible, increase seeker engagement and motivation through live, interactive learning. Zoom is a great tool for this and can be accompanied with other tools.
Chatbox
The chat box can be used to encourage students to ask questions to you or one another. 
Whiteboard
The shared whiteboard feature can be used to have students interact with you on the screen. By enabling annotation, your students can interact with you and one another in the whiteboard, whether through words or icons. 
Breakout Rooms
For your size class, we recommend breaking students up into 5-8 person groups. These groups can meet within breakout rooms on Zoom to further discuss any ideas or barriers they are facing. You can move from different groups to ensure you touch base with all students.
Text
Remind
The Remind app allows students to communicate with you and fellow students without divulging private information like your phone number. It can be used to send out mass emails and communications. 
Slack
Slack channels can be utilized for live, more structured conversations during courses. Private channels for students will foster collaboration and community within the class. 
You can set up slack channels where your students will receive participation/homework points by discussing lectures and course material on a weekly/daily basis. 
Other
One of the most important aspects of the transition to remote learning is filling in the informal learning gaps that are lost. With a class that is higher up in the taxonomy, it is vital to have discussions. Based on the other things you mentioned, here are some free options we think could help you. 
For gathering feedback from students, Menti is a great tools for live polls, quizzes and other general feedback.
For group projects and a more interactive component, using Mural could allow students to drive better outcomes and think more creatively. It will help you create an interactive environment that will supplement students in the process of analysis.
