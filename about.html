                  <h1>THE CONCEPT</h1>
                    
                  <h2>KEY TERMS</h2>
                  <p>Connector: An individual or group of individuals who equip seekers with the knowledge and skills to grow from this information and from other seekers</p>
                  <p>Seeker: Those who digest information, either directly from connectors or indirectly from other seekers, and grow and learn from this knowledge</p>
                  <p>An individual can be both a connector and seeker, formally in an organized programmatic setting or informally, where learning occurs organically and unintentionally.</p>
                  
                  <h2>THE LEARNING MATRIX</h2>
                  <p>The Learning Matrix (TLM) is a living, open-source platform built by and for connectors and seekers that transforms the value of traditional learning experiences into a central repository of information for effective, worthwhile, remote learning. </p>
                  <p>This seismic-level shift from in-person to online existence in the learning community was inevitable, yet no one was ready to adapt their methods and techniques this rapidly. TLM provides a space for connectors at all levels to quickly retrieve the resources they need to connect their students with each other and to knowledge despite being physically apart. The most valuable part of the platform is that it is completely informed by successful connectors, those who have proven which techniques and methods do and do not work. Connectors on the cutting edge of social learning and radical learning methods can make these practices available to all. TLM simply amplifies those voices and organizes them into a digestible matrix for other connectors to access. </p>
                  <p>TLM understands that the process of learning manifests differently in almost every possible scenario. So our team asked, How can we organize and categorize innovative learning strategies that span all scenarios? We present The TLM Method.</p>
                  
                    
                  <h1>THE METHOD</h1>  
                  <p>To ensure that we link connectors with tailored, customizable information, TLM’s content is organized along three different axes—audience size, level of collaboration and taxonomy of learning. Connectors can choose to fill in the criteria related most with their learning needs. TLM outputs a curated page of intentional strategies and tips for each connector’s needs, completely informed by other seekers innovating and testing these practices in real-time. Each connector will be fully equipped to help their seekers adjust to online, distanced learning.</p>
                    
                  <h3>Taxonomy of learning </h3>
                  <p>Taxonomy of learning axis was informed directly by Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning, rooted in the work of Benjamin Bloom. Although intended for elementary level education, this taxonomy of learning has proved useful in other non-traditional settings. TLM believes that any connector can fit their learning objectives under one of Bloom’s revised categories—create, evaluate, analyze, apply, understand, remember.</p>
                  <p>The beauty of Bloom’s taxonomy is its age. Constructed by psychologists in the 1950’s, learning specialists have implemented, tested and amended the taxonomy to pinpoint effective learning methods. A Harvard review speaks to the universality of the taxonomy and notes that: “Every discipline has some quibble with the specifics of these taxonomies. Our point is not to suggest that they are sacrosanct. Rather, [the model is] valuable as a heuristic—or even just as a lexicon of verbs for assignments—that can help you both when you are designing, and then when you are reflecting back on,  your lessons and assignments and the responses of your students to them.” We incorporate Bloom’s taxonomy into TLM as a metric by which to categorize methods knowledge connectors might employ to create learning experiences for knowledge seekers.</p>
                    
                  <h3>Levels of Collaboration</h3>
                  <p>Levels of collaboration was added to TLM to encourage connectors to think intentionally about the role they play in the connector-seeker relationship. Does the connector intend on a simple dialogue, where they present information that seekers silently digest? Or do they intend to promote synergistic collaboration where seekers play a significant role at all stages of the learning process.</p>
                  <p>Although the Level of Engagement axis is based on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) educational theory, it can be applied outside of traditional schooling environments. CoI is a new and highly researched theory that has become a valuable resource for the transition to online learning. The model is centered around three kinds of presences: teaching/teacher presence, cognitive presence and social presence. Each category addresses the level of collaboration for a given course and drives connectors to address important questions about the structure in which they present information. How do connectors want to interact with seekers? How do seekers want to engage with new material? How do seekers want to engage with each other?</p>
                    
                  <h3>Audience Size</h3>
                  <p>Audience size plays a significant role in changing learning strategies, especially in an online environment. This axis allows connectors to fully understand how promoting certain levels of learning and collaboration will manifest with certain numbers of seekers.</p>  
                    
                  <p>The answers to the questions above provide the framework TLM needs to give valuable recommendations to connectors and seekers.</p>

                <div class="column left" style="background-color:#FFB695;">
                <h2>TRANSPARENCY</h2>
                <p>TLM is an open, honest environment that ensures connectors are comfortable sharing their learning ideas, techniques and methods. In creating a transparent online environment, we hope to foster a sense of trust that enables free-flowing communication and effective reporting. </p>
            </div>
                <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#96D1CD;">
                <h2>COLLABORATION</h2>
                <p>No individual connector or seeker has the answer. Therefore, it is important to start a dialogue where connectors and seekers alike can listen, critique, improve and implement effective remote learning strategies. With more connectors participating and more voices informing TLM, there is an increased opportunity for effective, holistic learning approaches to be developed and shared.</p>
            </div>
                <div class="column right" style="background-color:#74C3E1;">
                <h2>COMMUNITY</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges when undergoing a remote transformation is the fear that the sense of in-person community that connectors and seekers relied on will be lost. TLM provides connectors with the tools to foster a community while remaining physically distant. And TLM doesn’t stop at the delivery of these strategies; it creates a community of connectors who are committed to lifelong learning and sharing their love of learning for the benefit of others.</p>

                <h2>ADAPTABILITY</h2>
                <p>DIf COVID-19 has taught the learning community anything, it is the importance of being flexible to an ever-changing situation. There is no essential formula or playbook detailing the ultimate way to learn through an online platform; this is the time where connectors and seekers must experiment and document how best to move forward. This is why having a platform where instructors who have tried new, online methods that they have found success in can spread their techniques to other professionals. We hope to create a culture where connectors can learn effective methods as they are created, so they can transfer and adapt their in-person strategies to be just as or more effective when being transformed remotely.</p>
